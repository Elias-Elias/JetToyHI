# JetToyHI

## Software

Inside the `PU14` directory you can find code we borrowed from the Pileup2014 workshop that takes care of reading in the events and mixing background with signal events.
Inside the `include` directory you can find a couple of classes performing background subtraction, grooming jets, and a jet-to-jet matching algorithm.
Follow the installation instructions below to run an example program.

## Install on lxplus

First install fastjet and the contrib package (you only have to do this once)
```sh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/contrib/gcc/4.8/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt/setup.sh

source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/6.06.08/x86_64-slc6-gcc48-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh

#Install fastjet (you just have to do this once)

curl -O http://fastjet.fr/repo/fastjet-3.3.0.tar.gzÂ 
tar zxvf fastjet-3.3.0.tar.gz
cd fastjet-3.3.0/

./configure --prefix=$PWD/../fastjet-install
make
make check
make install
FASTJET=$PWD
cd ..

export FJ_CONTRIB_VER=1.026 
curl -Lo source.tar.gz http://fastjet.hepforge.org/contrib/downloads/fjcontrib-"$FJ_CONTRIB_VER".tar.gz
tar xzf source.tar.gz
cd fjcontrib-"$FJ_CONTRIB_VER"
./configure --fastjet-config=$FASTJET/fastjet-config --prefix=`fastjet-config --prefix`
make 
make install 
make fragile-shared #make shared library
make fragile-shared-install
cd ..
```

Next steps
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mverwe/JetToyHI.git
cd JetToyHI
. setup.sh
echo $FASTJET > .fastjet
```

```sh
cd PU14
echo $FASTJET > .fastjet
./mkmk
make
cd ..

scripts/mkcxx.pl -f -s -1 -r -8 '-IPU14' -l '-LPU14 -lPU14 -lz'
make
./runFromFile -hard samples/PythiaEventsTune14PtHat120.pu14 -pileup samples/ThermalEventsMult12000PtAv0.70.pu14 -nev 10
```

* Fork the original repository. Go to: https://github.com/mverwe/JetToyHI and click 'Fork' in the upper right corner.
* Instead of cloning the original repository as shown above, clone your own.
* After committing your changes to your own branch, push them to your own fork. Don't know how to do this, ask your colleages or use google which might bring you here https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/
* Do a pull request once you have finished your developements.

## Samples
Event samples can be found on the jet quenching CERNBOX:
* From lxplus: /eos/project/j/jetquenching/JetWorkshop2017/samples
* Webbrowser: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/w2xgYEEkCWzDELR

You will find samples from various generators. For underlying event we have: 'thermal' which is independent particle production using a Boltzmann distribution with a fixed multiplicity and mean p~T~ (indicated in the file names). For the hard signal we have pythia8 events with various p~T,hat~ settings. *JEWEL is being produced as well*
