# Rivet analysis that looks at events with either dijet or photon+jet and performs coincidence analysis

to compile make sure you have the rootconfig (since for quick temp plotting in included root histograms etc...) and with the fastjet contrib fragile library with you can create with
make fragile-shared
make fragile-shared-install
in your fastjet-contrib location 

rivet-buildplugin RivetRecursive_Study.so Recursive_Study.cc  -lfastjetcontribfragile $(root-config --cflags --libs)

you can then run it on a given hepmc file and it will create a root file. Unfortunately the setup now needs the output file name adjusted and compiled before you run on a different hepmc sample.  

As of May 15th, ive only run the hadron+jet and photon+jet analysis with very simple pT cuts. Today i will include the STAR dijet selection and add more of the histograms we want to study.
